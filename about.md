<p>Hi, my name is <b>Kai Sasaki</b>. I am a software engineer living in Tokyo, Japan.
I live in this metropolis all my life. I have a passion for developing the artificial intelligence
that is the dream of humankind for a long time. By using web technologies, mathematics and big data, I am sure that
this dreams come true. In addition to this, I long for the world where technology supports our imcompleteness
which is burdened since human was born. So I dedicate myself to realize these ideal some day. This is my dream.</p>
