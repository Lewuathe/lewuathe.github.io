As I described before, I have written several books in English about distributed systems such as Hadoop and Spark. It was tough work for me to complete books in English but it brought me an irreplaceable experience. But the story has not been ended yet.

and also Hadoop book is available in Chinese. You can buy these books in [Amazon China](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B071FK78G8) or [DangDang](http://product.dangdang.com/24242197.html).

This is the first time for me to see my book translated into Chinese. Therefore it's an impressive experience too. 
All languages I can use and read are Japanese and English so I do not have such a time when I wish I could read Chinese. 

I want to appreciate the people who made an effort to publish these books.
