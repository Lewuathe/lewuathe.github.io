Today, [Go and Clojure compete with each other](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=golang%2C%20clojure&cmpt=q). [Go](http://golang.org/) will be one of the 
hottest programming language in this year. This is the compiler language which can be seen as the successor C++.

On the other hand, [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is the successor of Java which succeeded blending two programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and
functional programming.

These two languages are very similar to me. In developing deep learning module for myself, which language should I use? 
Or if I can ask more general question, which language will be the major static language in the field in which tough performance
and maintainability are required. If you have any good idea or criteria for selecting these two languages, please send good advice to [@Lewuathe](https://twitter.com/Lewuathe)

Thank you.
