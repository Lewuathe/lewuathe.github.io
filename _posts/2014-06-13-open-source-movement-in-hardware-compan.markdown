Tesla is famous for its motor products. These opened patents includes EV technologies for the future.
I think it will accelerate the speed of development of EV vehicles. So this decision plays a big role to
progress the bright future of motor technologies.

Above all, as a software engineer, it is great thing to spread open source movement into hardware companies.
