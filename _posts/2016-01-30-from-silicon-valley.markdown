This is very long time from the last time I wrote the blog. I don't want to say that, but I was busy.
I'm currently somewhat busy, but I want to write the current status of me. I have a business trip to Silicon Valley
about two weeks. It is a common thing for new comers to work at HQ for two weeks at [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com/).
So that's the reason why I am here.

It's the half way yet. This is the first weekend for me and the last one. So I came to Stanford University
to walking and searching for writing codes. Fortunately there are some places even guests can use for their work. Of course Wifi is provided. I can progress my project very comfortably.

Although I have to come back my Airbnb taking one hour... :(
