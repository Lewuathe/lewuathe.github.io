As touched on in this blog several times, I experimentally try to learn multiple languages simultaneously. The first one I started to study was Spanish before the pandemic. I added Chinese to the list last year. Now, I am starting to study Korean this summer. Although I gradually get used to Spanish and Chinese (at least reading and listening), it is still quite overwhelming to get in touch with multiple languages at the same time. These languages are not echoing around my daily life as I am living in Japan. Therefore, I do not even have any chance to make use of them! Not to mention the difficulty of continuing the study, it is also hard to keep motivated. 

In the middle of such a situation, it was not weird for me to find the following article interesting.

[How to Learn Two Languages At Once](https://blog.duolingo.com/can-you-learn-two-languages-at-the-same-time/)

The blog post published by Dualingo illustrates several tips to keep learning multiple foreign languages in parallel. 

I found the section for the short-time immersion applicable to my learning process based on my experience.

Short-time immersion is important to learn multiple languages at once. Instead of splitting the study time into morning and evening, we should allocate one consecutive time slot so that we can put ourselves into the language deeply. It makes a kind of flow mode to the language. In this mode, it is also useful to create a separate environment to study. For instance, we can study German in the morning in the kitchen while studying Spanish in the living room at night time. It makes our brain switch seamlessly without any trouble and focus on one language easily. Now, I am studying Spanish and Chinese as my second foreign languages. Let me try this method to get a deep immersion into these languages.
