Yesterday, I found that iOS app exported by [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) with [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) crashed as soon as launched.
This is critical problem because I cannot see the result totally! And I found [this page](http://qiita.com/JunSuzukiJapan@github/items/4e230f4a448f2db486f6)
This page described the simple process how to solve it.

## Setting orientation

In exported project, `Info.plist` should be rewritten. You add new item named `UIInterfaceOrientation` and set as you like.

That's all your Xcode project might not crash. Try it.
