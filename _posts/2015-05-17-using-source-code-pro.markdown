I have used [Ricty](https://github.com/yascentur/Ricty) as my main programming fonts for about two years. This is one of the best fonts I've ever used for programming.
However when I started using [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline), Ricty for powerline cannot be shown properly. Some garbles are occurred in my console.
So in this time, I also changed my main font to [Source Code Pro](https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-JP&event=displayFontPackage&code=1960)
provided by Adobe. This is clear enough to distinguish each character and useful for programming and writing some technical documents.

So far source code pro is only used in spacemacs and powerline, IntelliJ IDEA. I want to apply this font to other tools for my daily tasks.
Thank you.
