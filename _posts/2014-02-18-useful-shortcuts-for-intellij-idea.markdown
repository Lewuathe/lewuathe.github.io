In this week, I am attending a lecture for developing mobile application on android. 
Of course I had no experience writing android applications, I have not written Java code in my life.
Through this lecture, I was so impressed by the functionality of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

In my life, I hate using IDE because these tools always hide a mechanism for building application.
This is why I always used emacs or vim. But today, I changed my mind. IDE is the next step for me in order to acquire new skills. 
So just now I installed [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) which is in fashion nowadays.

In this post, I'd like to introduce some shortcuts for my kickstarting IntelliJ IDEA. If you know any other tips, please let me know.

| Short Cut | Function | Notes 
| :------------ | :-------------- | :-----------------
| Ctrl + Space  | Basic Code completion | With IntelliJ IDEA, however code completion is run automatically 
| Alt + Enter   | Show intention actions and quick-fixes | IntelliJ IDEA gives me any suggestions in each situations 
| Ctrl + Alt + L | Reformat code | Rearrange for readable format 
| Ctrl + Alt + O | Optimize imports | Remove unnecessary imports 
| Ctrl + Q | Quick documentation | Simple reference to javadoc 
| Ctrl + O | Override methods | Implements override methods of current class 
| Ctrl + / | Comment out/in a line 
| Ctrl + W | Select successively increasing code blocks | You can select a meaningful code blocks 
| Ctrl + Y | Delete line at caret |
| Shift + Enter | Start new line | Wherever line you are, insert new line
| Shift + F10 | Run | 
| Ctrl + Alt + V | Introduce variables | Make variables name automatically 
| Ctrl + J | Insert live templates | A lot of type of templates are preinstalled 

How do you think that? Of course, there are so many shortcuts and functions that I cannot introduce all of these.
The only way to know how useful IntelliJ IDEA is using it throughly! From today, I'll switch default editor to IntelliJ IDEA.

Thank you.
