I've just done career change. I quitted the company where I've worked for about 3 years.
That's the first company for me after graduating university. To make progress my career, I decided to change my affiliation.

<!-- more -->

I joined into [TreasureData](http://www.treasuredata.com/) which provides a cloud based data analysis service.
I was attracted the high level technologies and than anything I can work with a lot of great engineers. This week is the first week of
my working. I'm very looking forward to enhancing our service and pursue unexplored technologies.

Thank you. It regards the futures!
