One of the excellent habits I have obtained during the pandemic is learning another foreign language other than English. I loved traveling abroad before, but it is not possible due to Covid-19. To overcome this frustration positively, I decided to learn more about other foreign languages so that we can make use of that new skill someday.

The first one I choose is **Spanish**. Spanish is close to Japanese [in terms of its pronunciation](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-the-Japanese-sound-like-Spanish-and-other-Romantic-languages) and perhaps easy to learn its grammar according to some rumors by friends. Hace dos años que aprender español. Por eso, puedo hablar español poco a poco. Tengo que aumentar más vocabulario por la communicación con fluidez.

This time I found a way to change the input source to Spanish in macOS, which allow me to write Spanish more correctly.

1. On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Keyboard, then click Input Sources.
2. Click the Add button, then search for a Spanish
3. Click Add.
4. Change the input source to Spanish as you like.

If I get a chance, I want to write articles in Spanish to improve my writing skill in other languages.

¡Hasta luego!
