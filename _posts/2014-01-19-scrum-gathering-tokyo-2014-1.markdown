On January 14-15, I participated **[Scrum Gathering Tokyo 2014](http://scrumgatheringtokyo.org/2014/)**. 
Though this conference cost me a little more than I can afford it, 
it was great time to me as scrum master in my project. I want to arrange 
the contents of these sessions, but as there were many sessions it is hard to me.
So in this entry, I cite one scrum example after another which I heard in these sessions.

* Being and Becoming

    * About 70%

    * That's why agile is needed in many companies

* Scrum is applicable to business, generic and scaled techinics.


# Leading the Lean
* SAFe Roots
    * [Scaled Agile framwwork](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/)
* In scrum class, any code cannot be written
    * The process which can be used in real scene should be progressed in code level.


# Padawan scrum master

## First of all, let's study
* Read [Agile Estimating and Planning](http://www.amazon.co.jp/Estimating-Planning-Robert-Martin-Series/dp/0131479415%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJCKXRISJS6UE36NQ%26tag%3Dkakutani-22%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0131479415)
* Read [Agile Samurai](http://www.amazon.co.jp/The-Agile-Samurai-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356581/ref=sr_1_1?s=english-books&ie=UTF8&qid=1390134825&sr=1-1&keywords=Agile+Samurai)
* In the past, XP is the main stream in SIer.
    * XP is the idealistic thought. So it is not fit the real scene.
    * On the halfway, the members are bored with the process.
    * In the team which is composed of about 70 members, the standard process or documents should be arranged precisely.

## And hearing clients about necessary conditions
* Thinging of what to do
* It might be difficult to do scrum in enterprise enviroment

## How to estimate
* Very roughtly. 
* Hour unit, 3 days unit.
* From the beginning, chart is not burned down. Add tasks every day

## How to do contractually
* Introduce [Hybrid scrum](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9F%E8%B7%B5-%E8%8B%B1-%E7%B9%81%E9%9B%84/dp/4897979358)
* It is seemed like waterfall from outside.
    * The process which need approvals shoule be done waterfall process

## In the case that there are anyone who is negative to agile scrum
* Remove that member

## How to cope with the change order
* Require clients to line tasks by order, not attach the priority
    * If tasks are arranged one line, the order of task is explicit.

## Last but not least
* Scrum should be changed to fit your own team
* Some projects should be facilitated forcibly, like waterfall process
