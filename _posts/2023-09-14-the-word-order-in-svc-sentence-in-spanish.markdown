I found an interesting fact about the word order in Spanish when I read [the following book](https://amzn.to/3ZfWdlw) about the Spanish grammar. When we use *ser* or *estar* which are corresponding to 'be' in English, the word order is different from English. In the English lesson at the school, I have learned the word order of the sentence is SVC (Subject-Verb-Complement). Therefore, we can say

> This soup is good.

However, in Spanish, the word order is generally VCS (Verb-Complement-Subject).

> Está buena la sopa.

Looks like the verb is always regarded as the most important part of the sentence in Spanish even if it's just a 'be' verb. When we want to say the sentence in SVO order, we can say

> Compro la sopa.

which is in the same order as English. However, the word order is not always VCS. When we want to emphasize the subject, we can say

> La sopa está buena.

Spanish seems to be more flexible to the order of the sentence than English. That's what I found interesting in Spanish language when it comes to the difference from other languages like English.
