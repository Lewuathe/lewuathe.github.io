Since I'm not a native English speaker, I did not correctly interpret [this article](https://dustri.org/b/my-favourite-c-footgun.html) at first glance.

> My favourite C++ footgun

What is **footgun** in this place? I found this tweet answered my question.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Shooting yourself in the foot&quot; is an expression that means making a mistake. A footgun is a powerful tool that makes it easy to make terrible mistakes! It is mostly used in computer software. Normal people don&#39;t use &quot;footgun&quot;, which says something about computer software...</p>&mdash; Thomas Munro (@MengTangmu) <a href="https://twitter.com/MengTangmu/status/1069751647771877376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Therefore, a footgun is a functionality or feature of software initially assumed to be helpful but turns out to be harmful at the end of the day.
