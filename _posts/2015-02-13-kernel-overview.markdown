As a software engineer, we come to this point at last. Linux kernel is the bible and the ultimate stage all software engineers
should learn in their lifetime. So I started kernel learning seminar with my friends. In this week we held that at the first time.

At this time, we explained the overview of linux kernel functionalities.

* Kernel source tree
* Process and memory
* Resource management
* File system
* Network
* Device
* Compile and install instruction

Although I want to read original kernel source code one by one, the first tasks I have to do is creating the map of kernel
functionalities and source tree. In this section, I introduced some terminologies which is implemented in latest kernel.
Of course there are some missing items, I think. But I am sure that with this entry point, we can start learning by myself.
We can research technologies, start subscribing a mailing list and hacking it. All kernel hackers must stand this point at the first time. I was so impressed by the fact that I have reached at the foot of kernel mountain eventually. This was so exciting!
There are a lot of things to learn in front of me in order to hack kernel.

Now I have an enough energy to progress this learning
through my engineer life. This is the chance to get forward my skill and fulfill my knowledge desire as a software engineer.
If you have any interest contents to learn linux kernel, please let me know. I will also share my learning results here.

Thank you.
