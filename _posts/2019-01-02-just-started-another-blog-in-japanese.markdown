One thing I have found difficult again is that keep updating the blog constantly. Writing a blog post is a time-consuming work to me even now. If I am busy or have trouble in my life, keep updating blog post shows up to me as a low priority task because it is no obligation to me. It does not produce money. Even I forget to write the post, nobody cares. But it still takes some amount of time to complete a blog post. One reason I take so much time to write is writing in English. It's not my mother tongue. Every time I start writing, it is inevitable to bring my dictionary (a.k.a Google) and check grammatical error. I'm a still English learner.

So I decided to start [another blog](https://note.mu/lewuathe) in Japanese.

This is the challenge this year to keep updating both blogs and will compare how it is improved by writing in Japanese at the end of this year. I hope they are both attractive to readers.

Thanks!
