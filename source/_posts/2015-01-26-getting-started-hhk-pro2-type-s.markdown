I obtained [HHK Pro2 Type-S US](http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/type-s/) version. This is the keyboard which I long for a long time.

Typing touch is very light. So you won't be tired even if keep typing long document or programs.
In addition to this, the sound of typing is very low. I heard that normal HHK Pro2 is a little noisy
when you do strong typing. Type-S is not the case.(But I cannot compare with normal HHK Pro2 because I don't have one)
The kind of sound of key-typing looks different from normal HHK. Type-S's sound is more soft. So you will be no more
irritated. I believe my efficiency and productivity will be rising. I have a lot of projects what I want to do in this year.

Thank you.
